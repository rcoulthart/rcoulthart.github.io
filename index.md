Ross is modelling lead on this project aiming to transform the accessibility of Ayr Town Centre with major public realm and infrastructure improvements for active travel. Ross designed a comprehensive survey programme and updated the Ayr Town Centre Paramics Model to help inform the design process, understand potential impacts to road users and appraise options in terms of traffic metrics such as speed, trip duration, journey times and queue lengths. Data sources included ANPR, TomTom floating car data and automatic traffic counters. 3D animated visualisations were produced using kepler.gl.

### Covid-19 Wellbeing Tracker

During the Covid-19 Pandemic I developed voluntary, anonymous wellbeing trackers for teams to help monitor mental health and wellbeing trends during lockdowns and other restrictions. I designed questionnaire surveys and an automated system to issue, process and provide dashboard visualisations using Power Automate and PowerBI. Employees could also request support from Line Managers, Mental Health First Aiders, Wellbeing Champions, or the Employee Assistance Programme through the system.

### A96 Dualling

I am modelling lead for traffic and economic assessment of the western section of proposed A96 Dualling Inverness to Aberdeen. I am responsible for methodology, development of scheme scenario tests using a transport model, economic analysis, provision of outputs for other project team disciplines including environment and design and quality assurance through peer review. I developed scripting and pipelines to efficiently deliver model outputs and visualisations for a large number of scenario tests. This was used to appraise the scheme against objectives and undertake cost-benefit analysis.

I was project manager on this commission to advise South Lanarkshire Council on approaches to electrification, charging infrastructure investment and fleet management. The study included detailed analysis of fleet telematics data, a review of SLCâ€™s vehicle replacement programme, GIS analysis of vehicle parking locations using telematics, assessment of home-based, depot-based and strategic hub charging options, a review of associated costs for charging infrastructure, and a review of potential funding sources. Data was analysed using Python, Jupyter Notebooks and the Seaborn visualisation library. Recommendations were made for reducing mileage, encouraging behaviour change, downsizing fleet, managing charging infrastructure, progressing the rollout of infrastructure and monitoring objectives.

I led development of a model for assessing operation and capacity of proposed site layouts for a mass vaccination centre. I worked closely with NHS Lothian, QMU, architects and contractors to feedback insights from the modelling and test proposals. Recommendations included changes to the facility layout, increasing the number of entrance arrival lanes, advice on the number of operatives required, signing strategy and providing additional checking stations for patient registration.
