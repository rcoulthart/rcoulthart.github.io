Ross is modelling lead on this project aiming to transform the accessibility of Ayr Town Centre with major public realm and infrastructure improvements for active travel. Ross designed a comprehensive survey programme and updated the Ayr Town Centre Paramics Model to help inform the design process, understand potential impacts to road users and appraise options in terms of traffic metrics such as speed, trip duration, journey times and queue lengths. Data sources included ANPR, TomTom floating car data and automatic traffic counters. 3D animated visualisations were produced using Kepler GL.
