  I have over 18 yearsâ€™ experience leading modelling and data analysis teams in private sector consultancy. I have worked on a range of projects as part of international multi-disciplinary teams in collaboration with clients and stakeholders. I thrive in an environment that is fast-paced and technically challenging, collaborating to unpick difficult problems and find innovative data-driven solutions. I am reliable to deliver on independent tasks and line manage resources effectively and efficiently. I have led teams with agile methods to deliver high profile projects for clients such as Glasgow City Council and Transport Scotland, delivering to programme and budget and exceeding expectations.

  In my current role I apply analytical skills to complex transport problems spanning highways, public transport, active travel and aviation using the latest analytical tools and methods. I regularly use SQL, Python and its associated data science and visualisation libraries, and business intelligence tools such as PowerBI. I have a reputation for being a methodical and scientific thinker, improving quality and efficiency of deliverables through innovation and automation, and presenting a narrative of results clearly and concisely. I have a strong grasp of statistical techniques and development of robust algorithms and a good eye for presenting data in a simple, informative, and visually-engaging way to non-technical audiences. I am a strong communicator and have been an expert witness at public inquiry and in arbitration.
  <br><br>
  Throughout my career I have worked with distributed teams from many different disciplines and have learned the value and efficacy of collaboration. I am quick to offer help where I believe my skills will bring added value and will seek out the expertise of others as necessary to enhance project outcomes. I have experience in training and mentoring junior staff in robust analysis and delivering actionable insights.    <br><br>
