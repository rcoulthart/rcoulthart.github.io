  I have over 18 yearsâ€™ experience leading modelling and data analysis teams in private sector consultancy. I have worked on a range of projects as part of international multi-disciplinary teams in collaboration with clients and stakeholders. I thrive in an environment that is fast-paced and technically challenging, collaborating to unpick difficult problems and find innovative data-driven solutions.
  <br><br>
  In my current role I apply analytical skills to complex transport problems spanning highways, public transport, active travel and aviation using the latest analytical tools and methods. I have a strong grasp of statistical techniques and a good eye for presenting data in a simple, informative, and visually-engaging way to non-technical audiences.
