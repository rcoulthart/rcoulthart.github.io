  I have over 18 yearsâ€™ experience leading modelling and data analysis teams in private sector consultancy. I have worked on a range of projects as part of international multi-disciplinary teams in collaboration with clients and stakeholders. I thrive in an environment that is fast-paced and technically challenging, collaborating to unpick difficult problems and find innovative data-driven solutions. I am reliable to deliver on independent tasks and line manage resources effectively and efficiently.
  <br><br>
  In my current role I apply analytical skills to complex transport problems spanning highways, public transport, active travel and aviation using the latest analytical tools and methods. I have a reputation for being a methodical and scientific thinker, improving quality and efficiency of deliverables through innovation and automation, and presenting a narrative of results clearly and concisely.
  <br><br>
  Throughout my career I have worked with distributed teams from many different disciplines and have learned the value and efficacy of collaboration. I am quick to offer help where I believe my skills will bring added value and will seek out the expertise of others as necessary to enhance project outcomes. I have experience in training and mentoring junior staff in robust analysis and delivering actionable insights. I have a strong grasp of statistical techniques and development of robust algorithms and a good eye for presenting data in a simple, informative, and visually-engaging way to non-technical audiences.
